# Migrate to Content x UI v3

2025 starts with the power of **3**. This begining of year, weâ€™re bringing major updates to our favorite tools. The UI team is about to launch version 3 of the **UI / UI Pro libraries** (now in alpha), while the Content team has already released **Nuxt Content v3**.

These updates mean that all our starter templates combining **Content** and **UI** will need to be updated to align with the latest versions. To help you make the transition, this guide walks through migrating the **Docs Starter** to the new **Content x UI v3** package.
